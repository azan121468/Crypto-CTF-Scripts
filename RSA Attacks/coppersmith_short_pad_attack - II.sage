# Franklin-Reiter attack against RSA.
# If two messages differ only by a known fixed difference between the two messages
# and are RSA encrypted under the same RSA modulus N
# then it is possible to recover both of them.

# Inputs are modulus, known difference, ciphertext 1, ciphertext2.
# Ciphertext 1 corresponds to smaller of the two plaintexts. (The one without the fixed difference added to it)
